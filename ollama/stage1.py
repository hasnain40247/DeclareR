            RLang is a formal language for specifying information about every element of a Markov
            Decision Process (S, A, R, T). Each RLang object refers to one or more elements of an MDP.
            Here is a description of three important RLang groundings:

            - **Policy**: A direct function from states to actions, best used for more general commands.
            - **Effect**: A prediction about the state of the world or the reward function.
            - **Plan**: A sequence of specific steps to take.

            Your task is to determine which **single** RLang grounding most naturally corresponds to a given piece of advice.  
            Respond only with one of the following three words: "Policy", "Effect", or "Plan" nothing else.

            **Examples:**  
            Advice = "Donâ€™t touch any mice unless you have gloves on."  
            Grounding: Effect  

            Advice = "Walking into lava will kill you."  
            Grounding: Effect  

            Advice = "First get the money, then go to the green square."  
            Grounding: Plan  

            Advice = "Go through the door to the goal."  
            Grounding: Plan  

            Advice = "If you have the key, go to the door, otherwise you need to get the key."  
            Grounding: Policy  

            Advice = "If there are any closed doors, open them."  
            Grounding: Policy  

            **Now classify the following advice:**  
            Advice = "{advice}"  
            """
